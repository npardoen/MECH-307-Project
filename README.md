# MECH-307-Project

The Dawg Feeder is an automated and remotely controlled pet feeder designed for large dogs, developed for MECH 307 at Colorado State University. It uses an Arduino Mega, servo-driven food doors, submersible water pumps, and sensors to dispense food and water either manually via an IR remote or automatically via a photoresistor. A flowchart and function diagram illustrate how inputs control the mechanical actions and display outputs. Testing showed that the system performed as intended, though waterproofing and pump mounting improvements would enhance reliability. Key lessons included the importance of early part sourcing, iterative testing, and protecting electronics from water exposure.
