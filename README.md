# MECH 307-Project

This project was created in the fall semester of 2023. The project consisted of four team members( Nathan Pardoen, Jack Cavo, Haydn Simpson, and Justin Rudrow). The goal of this project was to integrate electrical and mechanical systems into a single device based on what was learned in the lecture and the lab.
